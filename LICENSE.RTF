          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the\par
          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims\par
          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by\par
          that Contributor.\par
\par
3. Distribution Obligations.\par
\par
     3.1. Application of License.\par
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\par
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\par
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\par
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\par
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\par
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\par
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\par
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\par
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\par
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in\par
     Section 3.5.\par
\par
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\par
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\par
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\par
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\par
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\par
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\par
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\par
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six\par
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\par
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\par
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\par
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\par
\par
     3.3. Description of Modifications.\par
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\par
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\par
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\par
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\par
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\par
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\par
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\par
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\par
\par
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\par
          (a) Third Party Claims.\par
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's\par
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\par
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\par
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\par
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the\par
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\par
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\par
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\par
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\par
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\par
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\par
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\par
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\par
\par
          (b) Contributor APIs.\par
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\par
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\par
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\par
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.\par
\par
               (c)    Representations.\par
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\par
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\par
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\par
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\par
          this License.\par
\par
     3.5. Required Notices.\par
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\par
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\par
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\par
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\par
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\par
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\par
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\par
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\par
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\par
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\par
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\par
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\par
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\par
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\par
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\par
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\par
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\par
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\par
\par
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\par
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\par
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\par
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\par
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\par
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\par
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\par
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\par
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\par
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\par
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\par
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\par
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\par
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\par
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\par
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\par
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\par
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\par
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\par
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\par
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\par
     terms You offer.\par
\par
     3.7. Larger Works.\par
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\par
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\par
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\par
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\par
\par
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\par
\par
     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\par
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\par
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\par
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\par
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\par
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\par
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\par
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\par
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\par
     understand it.\par
\par
5. Application of this License.\par
\par
     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\par
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\par
\par
6. Versions of the License.\par
\par
     6.1. New Versions.\par
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised\par
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version\par
     will be given a distinguishing version number.\par
\par
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\par
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\par
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\par
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\par
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one\par
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to\par
     Covered Code created under this License.\par
\par
     6.3. Derivative Works.\par
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\par
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\par
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\par
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",\par
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your\par
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)\par
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\par
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\par
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial\par
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\par
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\par
     this License.)\par
\par
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\par
\par
     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,\par
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\par
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\par
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\par
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\par
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\par
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\par
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\par
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\par
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\par
\par
8. TERMINATION.\par
\par
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\par
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\par
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\par
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\par
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\par
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\par
     shall survive.\par
\par
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\par
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\par
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\par
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:\par
\par
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\par
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\par
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\par
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\par
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\par
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\par
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\par
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\par
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\par
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\par
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\par
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\par
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\par
     the 60 day notice period specified above.\par
\par
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\par
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\par
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\par
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\par
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\par
     Participant.\par
\par
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\par
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\par
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\par
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\par
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\par
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\par
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\par
     license.\par
\par
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\par
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\par
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\par
     prior to termination shall survive termination.\par
\par
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\par
\par
     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\par
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\par
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\par
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\par
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\par
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\par
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\par
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\par
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\par
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\par
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\par
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\par
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\par
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\par
\par
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\par
\par
     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in\par
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer\par
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such\par
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\par
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\par
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\par
     rights set forth herein.\par
\par
11. MISCELLANEOUS.\par
\par
     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\par
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\par
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\par
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\par
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\par
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\par
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\par
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\par
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\par
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\par
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\par
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\par
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\par
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\par
