<h3>License questions</h3>
<p><strong> 1) Can I include and distribute Report Manager in my commercial product?<br>
  </strong>This is not a problem, the MPL allow linking/using with comercial products.</p>
<p> <strong>2) Where do you draw the line about what enhacements of the engine 
  must be MPL and what are not required to be MPL?</strong></p>
<p>The line is drawn by the license, you will see the concept &quot;larger work&quot;, 
  I think it's impossible to define this line exactly, this are things where a 
  judge is needed, by examinig the license and the use of it, if a conflict appear.<br>
  Usually a conflict appear because the main autor gets angry because someone 
  have used the engine in ways not permitted by the license. For example if you 
  get the engine as it's now and sell it with a license fee model, omiting the 
  license and the autor of the software.</p>
<p>Next question will explain a few cases so you can understand the concept better.</p>
<p> <strong>3) Some of the changes that I need to make involves 3rd party libraries</strong></p>
<p>Report Manager allow the use of third party commercial librarys, no problem, 
  consider three cases:<br>
  1- A commercial DBExpress database driver.<br>
  Obviously it's linked with Report Manager, but there are a lot of reasons that 
  probes it's not a Report Manager enhacement:<br>
  a) It also works with other software<br>
  b) It's not designed exclusively to work with Report Manager<br>
  c) Does not enhace the report engine itself but just a capability of handling 
  another database technology.</p>
<p>2- A export filter to csv output (no need because already done inside the engine)<br>
  a) It's designed to work only with Report Manager.<br>
  b) It enhaces the engine capabilities.<br>
  c) It's not a program that works without Report Manager.</p>
<p>3- Another export filter to pdf (not the one already implemented) using a super 
  pdf component with lot of features available for Delphi X and installable on 
  the Delphi component palete.<br>
  a) It's designed to work with any software written in Delphi<br>
  b) It enhaces the engine capabilities<br>
  c) It's a component that works with Report Manager</p>
<p>Case 1:<br>
  - You don't need to provide the dbexpress driver as MPL.<br>
  Case 2:<br>
  - You should provide the output filter within the MPL license.<br>
  Case 3:<br>
  - You do not need to provide the PDF export component as MPL, but may be good 
  and reasonable you provide the interface from Report Manager to the PDF component. 
  So anyone that purchased that component can use it in Report Manager, that is 
  because you enhaced the engine a bit by allowing the use of that component, 
  but I think it's not clearly mandatory.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>4) I need scripting capabilities (I will use XXXXScript)</strong></p>
<p>Scripting is limited in Report Manager, but the best way is to program an enhacement 
  or interface to allow Report Manager work with any scripting engine (Ruby,Python,Passcript). 
  The interface should be MPL, while scripting libraries can have other license. 
</p>
<p><strong>5) I need to save report templates in XML or other format.</strong></p>
<p>The export to XML should be MPL but it's not required because can be programmed 
  as an idependent program called as reptoxml for example, so it's considered 
  a external tool, but will benefit you to be inside Report Manager (new properties 
  etc). </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>6) Do I need to make these enhancements available? Who decides?</strong></p>
<p>You decide about this, but you must consider the MPL license, a small enhacement 
  very dependent on Report Manager is clearly candidate as MPL license, larger 
  works is a case by case.<br>
  Anyway because you benefit from enhacements provided by MPL license by other 
  developers you should provide enhacements in MPL unless:<br>
  - The release of the feature will low your sales, or will produce you any loss. 
  Usually the contrary because the feature is included in the engine forever and 
  you don't worry about adding it in each update. Usually you will not loss sales 
  unless you are selling an addon to the Reporting engine, so in this cases you 
  should respect the MPL license and honestly decide.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>7) Do I need to make all changes using {$IFDEF} ?</strong></p>
<p> When you use products that other people not use, and you share same code base, 
  the answer is yes, to not become a nightmare the IFDEFS are minimized, for example:</p>
<p>uses<br>
  {$IFDEF USEMYOWNCOMPONENT}<br>
  mycomponentunit,<br>
  {$ENDIF}</p>
<p>{$IFDEF USEMYOWNCOMPONENT}<br>
  CreateMyComponent;<br>
  UseMyComponent;<br>
  {$ENDIF}</p>
<p>This allows you a single codebase for the shared code, note that you will benefit 
  about this model also used by other developers adding his own features.</p>
<p>Of course, if the feature is completely MPL and included in codebase no IFDEFS 
  are needed.</p>
<p> <strong>8) I don't want to make it public that I am using MPL Source when 
  I distribute my application in binary format. Some customers may get the impression 
  that I am selling them something which should be free.</strong></p>
<p>The license don't force you to place any message about the author in your software. 
  You can remove any about box annonying you, there is already an option to do 
  it.</p>
<p>I think it's ok to place at your license a message like:</p>
<p>- The reporting engine is based on Report Manager (http://reportman.sourceforge.net)</p>
<p>Don't know if omiting any reference violates de license but anyway is not very 
  ethic, you have benefits using the software.<br>
  Let's explain to your customers that a product containing a free product can 
  be a non-free product. This is specially true when your product is a large work, 
  or simply with a diferent purpose. For example a product working on top of Linux 
  can be priced, but you should say if asked that Linux is free software and have 
  no redistribution limitations.</p>
<p><strong>9) Can I download the code and maintain my own Report Manager version?</strong></p>
<p>You can get all the code and begin your own branch of the engine, but this 
  will cause you a lot of work when you want to add features on your branch that 
  are on mine and viceversa. In opensource world, the branches are created when 
  there is no other way to go, beacuse they consume resources (time).</p>
