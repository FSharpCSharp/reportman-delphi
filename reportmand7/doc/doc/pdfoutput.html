<h3>Adobe PDF output</h3>
<p>Native pdf output is implemented, you may experiment that the pdf output is 
  lighting fast compared to Acrobat Distiller and other print drivers that output 
  pdf, this is because the translation is done directly from Report Manager native 
  format to Adobe PDF format.</p>
<p>To enable truetype font embedding in a report, at the designer select Edit-&gt;Select 
  all texts, then at object inspector select Truetype font option in PDF Font 
  property. </p>
<p>But you may take consideration the following issues and limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unicode is  supported only if the original font supports unicode </li>
  <li>True type font linking and embedding is available from version 2.2, but 
    see bellow details of the implementation.</li>
  <li>Only Jpeg and Windows Bitmap image formats are supported.</li>
  <li>Compression is available, and used by default, but some pdf viewers does 
    not read PDF compressed files, the official Adobe PDF reader does not have 
    such problems.</li>
  <li>Composite fonts and CID Fonts are not supported, that is are supported but 
    PDF output processed as single fonts.</li>
  <li>The engine is faster and the file is smaller if you use standard Type 1 
    fonts (Courier/Times/Helvetica)</li>
  <li>The TrueType font embedding enlarges the file size of the PDF file. Better 
    optimization is hard to done (remove unused glyphs for example). You can use 
    TrueType font linking if you know the destination computers have the font 
    installed. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux and Windows, different technologies, different implementation</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Windows already have a font cache, that is any application can ask 
  information about installed fonts, including obtaining the entire font file 
  (to be embedded), also the operating system will search the most appropiate 
  font when the original font is not available (font matching). Implementation 
  works for TrueType and OpenType fonts, but some fonts can not be embedded (I 
  didn't found anyone), that is the API does not allow to get font data for that 
  fonts (maybe distribution license issues?)</p>
<p>Linux does not have a standard font service in the operating system itself, 
  instead of this it has libraries that provides some services, and of course 
  there is the X library.</p>
<p><strong>The X client library</strong></p>
<p>There are funtions in the X protocol to retrieve sizing infomation about installed 
  fonts (in the server), but this information is not complete, and there is no 
  way to retrieve full font data (the font file), some work have been done, there 
  is a project called X print server in early stages, this requires the installation 
  of a X print server process, and X print client libraries, but this is not the 
  good way.</p>
<p>There is also a font information library Xft, the good thing is that it can 
  work optionally with font servers, the bad thing is that does not provide enought 
  information (font file data). Anyway it depends on a running X server (bad thing 
  for console applications).</p>
<p>Applications like OpenOffice take the font information from the computer executing 
  the X client program not the X server so the X server protocol probably does 
  not allow to work with sever side installed fonts.</p>
<p>Another library providing font services Fontconfig, font config provides font 
  informantion and font matching services, but does not provide enought information 
  (char sizes and full font data), it's designed as very basic font information 
  system.</p>
<p>But a great <strong>library is usually available in Linux systems, <a href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net">freetype 
  library</a></strong>, Report Manager implementation is done using the version 
  2.1.8, but it's compatible with 2.X version, <strong>you will find it as freetype2 
  in your linux distribution </strong>, and the <strong>shared object needed is 
  libfreetype.so</strong>. Usually is installed by default, probably minimal console 
  Linux installations does not install it, Report Manager will need it only if 
  you use TrueType font embedding or linking.</p>
<p>Because freetype allows the access to Type1 fonts information, <strong>the 
  Type1 fonts can be also used in a pdf but only linking is available</strong>, 
  because of the requirements of PDF specification there is additional work to 
  embed Type1 fonts.</p>
<p>Unfortunatelly the freetype library does not implement font maching (and font 
  information file catching), bug at least it can provide full information about 
  font files, also extended information and can also render fonts. So simple font 
  matching is done in code at Report Manager engine.</p>
<p>Report Manager <strong>uses /etc/fonts/fonts.conf file to search for font directories</strong>, 
  the font information is cached the first time a TrueType font embedding is required, 
  but to retrieve this information costs reading all font files and get information 
  about the fonts (font names, styles...) to perform font maching. This process 
  is done once, but it's expensive when you execute only one report (printreptopdf 
  command line tool for example). Note that this overhead will not appear if you 
  don't embbed PDF fonts. Depending on the number of fonts you have installed 
  it will be not noticeable. </p>
<p>The good thing is that <strong>you don't need a X server</strong> generate 
  the pdfs with TrueType embedding.</p>
<p>The font maching algorith inside Report Manager is really simple, search for 
  the same family name and style, else search for a similiar family name, else 
  get a default font and apply the style. Note that Fontconfig does not force 
  font maching to his own unique way like Microsoft Windows do (give few options), 
  but you must provide preferences about the most important features of the font 
  to match. Maybe a future enhacement to use FontConfig for font matching but 
  for now it only adds a dependence to enhace a little the matching algorithm 
  (maybe only font information caching is only the reason to use it).</p>
