<h3><b>Database access information</b></h3>
<p>This documentation will help you to solve problems and setup your database.</p>
<p><strong>Check installation</strong></p>
<p>Before beginning the troubleshooting you should check this items:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Install the client database software correctly, and server database if needed</li>
  <li>Check your database connection with a standard TCP/IP connection application 
    provided by the database vendor. Check you can access tables and fields executing 
    some querys</li>
  <li>Install additional software if needed, for example if you plan to access 
    the database throught ODBC, install the ODBC software (unixODBC in Linux/ODBC32 
    in Microsoft Windows) and make sure to use ODBC driver compatible with the 
    version you installed. Again check ODBC connections with the provided ODBC 
    client tools.</li>
  <li>Check you are using the correct or latest drivers, for example for Visual 
    FoxPro you should download the ODBC driver update from Microsoft web site.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will ensure the database software is correctly installed.</p>
<p><strong>Database drivers overview</strong></p>
<p>There are some database drivers to connect with Report Manager to databases, 
  usually a connection can be done using different database drivers, each database 
  driver can have issues or bugs, if you find a issue using a database driver 
  you should ask about the issue in a correct place.</p>

<p>You can also purchase drivers to third party, usually for a fee, you can find 
  more DBExpress drivers, more ODBC drivers etc.</p>
<p><strong>DBExpress</strong></p>
<p>DBExpress is a technology introduced by Borland since the release of Delphi 
  6, as a replacement for the Borland Database Engine SQL Links, see section about 
  BDE bellow for more information.</p>
<p>DBExpress libraries are small and efficient, they are easy to update when a 
  version change of the vendor occur. </p>
<p>The main problem is that, Borland, the main developer of DBExpress drivers, 
  does not frequently update this drivers, because limited resources etc.., this 
  is a important issue because some database engine change versions often, this 
  changes introduce sometimes incompatibilities (PostgreSQL, MySQL). </p>
<p>Borland was not released sourcecode of DBExpress drivers (but released the 
  specification so third party can write them), so you can't update the Borland 
  provided DBExpress drivers.</p>

<p><strong>Troubleshooting for all drivers</strong></p>
<p>Check the libraries you need are in your system, you can also check dependences. 
  If you have problems with some datatypes you can try to set BlobSize to a value 
  like 10000</p>
<p> <strong>Unable to load library &quot;libraryname&quot;</strong></p>
<p> This message is raised when the vendor librarys are not installed or are a 
  different incompatible version, it's reported to work to install the correct 
  version for the DBExpress driver.</p>
<p>Note that the error message usually refers to the DBExpress driver library, 
  not the vendor library but the problem is in the vendor library.</p>
<p>For example when using Oracle 9i, you can install the Oracle 8i client library 
  in the directory where Report Manager is installed, so Oracle 8i client library 
  will be used, this is usually not recomended by the database vendor, so be aware 
  of the risk, especially when updating the database (working with report libraries).</p>
<p>Check the dependences with a programming tool, for example in Linux:</p>
<p>ldd libsqlpg.so</p>
<p>It reports a link to libpq.so.2 so you should create a symbolic link if this 
  library does not exists:</p>
<p>ln -s /usr/lib/libsqlpg.so.2 /usr/lib/libsqlpg.so.3</p>
<p><strong>Borland Database Engine</strong></p>
<p>Borland Database Engine was released by Borland since the first version of 
  Delphi, and have been updated until Delphi 6.</p>
<p>It's not provided by default on Report Manager, unless you purchase the <a href="../contrib.html" target="_blank">Standard 
  Edition</a>. </p>
<p> It's a really mature engine, but is big and have some overhead when accessing 
  to SQL servers. It's very good to access <strong>DBase, Foxpro, and Paradox</strong> 
  files because it includes a <strong>Local SQL processing</strong> engine for 
  this file based databases, can also access text files and have a automatic and 
  mature <strong>ODBC bridge</strong>. It has an interesting and flexible database 
  connection manager, you can configure and test database connections using <strong>Borland 
  Database engine configuration at the control panel</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>SQL Links</strong> are libraries installed with the Borland Database 
  Engine, this SQL Links will not be updated in a future and was not updated from 
  Delphi 6 release, I think from 2001, so you can have problems if you access 
  a database server wich changed the client/server protocol or client libraries 
  since that date. If you want continuing using BDE and the <strong>SQL Link is 
  out of data you can create a ODBC connection</strong>, and install the correct 
  driver for the newer database version. </p>
<p>The SQL Links provided are:</p>
<table border="1">
  <tr> 
    <td>Interbase (also works for Firebird) supporting only Dialect 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Microsoft Access</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>IBM DB2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Informix</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Microsoft SQL Server</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Oracle</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Sybase</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Borland replace the BDE SQL Links with DBExpress, because BDE is big in size 
  (and functionallity), it's not cross-platform, and the update and programming 
  of SQL Links (drivers for SQL engines) is a difficult thing, and can be done 
  only by Borland. So for all SQL Servers is recommended the use of DBExpress.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft DAO</strong></p>
<p>This driver is based on Borland interface to Microsoft Data Access Objects, 
  it only works in Microsoft Windows, there is a wizard to build connection strings 
  to connect to any installed OLE DB provider or ODBC datasource. This is a common 
  system for database connection for Microsoft enabled development environments 
  like Visual Basic, Visual FoxPro...</p>
<p><strong>ZeosLib</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://zeoslib.sourceforge.net">Zeos library</a> is a component set 
  to access some database engines, it's compiled inside all Report Manager binaries, 
  so you can use it normally, but if you use Report Manager components and want 
  to add the support in compilation (Kylix/Builder/Delphi) modify the rpconf.inc 
  file to enable the Zeos Library compiling and linking.</p>
<p>Usually you set the hostname, database, user name and password, but other parameters 
  are available like the TCP/IP port and character set.</p>
<p>To configure ZeosLib connections the same files as DBExpress drivers are used 
  (dbxdrivers and dbxconnections).</p>
<p>This driver is allows reading of TClientDataset files (.cds) in binary or XML 
  format, also allows reading of text files as a database.</p>
<p>The protocol property allow the selection of the database server. It supports 
  Mysql,Ppostgresql, Interbase/Firebird, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, Oracle 
  and IBM DB2.</p>
<p><strong>Interbase Express</strong></p>
<p>This driver is based on Interbase Express components provided by Borland in 
  Delphi/Kylix and C++Builder environments, the main advantage is that no external 
  shared object libraries are needed.</p>
<p><strong>Interbase Objects</strong></p>
<p>This driver is only available for Windows, it's implemented but not provided 
  because it's a comercial product. Allow access to Interbase and Firebird.</p>
<p><strong>Mybase</strong></p>
<p>This driver is allows reading of TClientDataset files (.cds) in binary or XML 
  format, also allows reading of text files as a database.</p>
<h3><strong>Getting to work all databases and database drivers in Suse 9.0</strong></h3>
This section will give you the steps to configure and use the databases provided 
  in Suse 9.0. For each database different drivers will be used.
<p><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></p>
<p>Execute Yast, install PostgreSQL server packages and client packages (this 
  where not installed by default), the important file missing by default to install 
  is libpq.so.3, located at a client library package. I went to Software installation 
  selected search postgre and checked all related packages to be sure.</p>
<p>Related packages: postgresql-libs pgaccess postgresql</p>
<p>First step is to start and setup the server I had some problems here because 
  I'm new to PostgreSQL, I don't know if the way I do things is ok but it worked, 
  I don't know why this steps are not done automatically by the setup scripts 
  in software installation. Of course that forced me understanding how PostgreSQL 
  works, learn reading documentation and also loosing lot of time.</p>
<p>We will also install the unixODBC related packages and the qt and tk interfaces 
  for configuration, this is for testing purposes , if you do not plan to use 
  ODBC you don't need them. This are packages: unixODBC unixODBC-gui-qt unixODBC-gui-tk 
  psqlODBC</p>
<p>The startup script uses the postgres user to launch the PostgreSQL server for 
  security reasons, so this user have limited privileges but should have all the 
  privileges for the main &quot;database repository&quot;, we will create a database 
  directory and give ownership to this user.</p>
<p>Login as root and type:</p>
<p>mkdir /var/pgdata</p>
<p>chown postgres /var/pgdata</p>
<p>Now we must initialize the &quot;database repository&quot;, but we must do 
  it with postgres user, another problem here, I dont know the postgres default 
  password, so I changed the password with the Yast configuratoin tool.</p>
<p>Login as postgres and type:</p>
<p>initdb -D/var/pgdata</p>
<p>This initializes the &quot;database repository&quot;.</p>
<p>Before starting the service we should say to the startup script /etc/init.d/postgresql 
  the location of &quot;database repository&quot;. I did it by executing the Yast 
  tool: Editor for /etc/sysconfig. Go to the branch Applications-PostgreSQL and 
  set:</p>
<p>POSTGRES_DATADIR /var/pgdata</p>
<p>POSGRES_OPTIONS -i</p>
<p>The -i option is to tell PostgreSQL to listen TCP/IP incoming connections.</p>
<p>Now we will start the database server but we will need to restart in a few 
  minutes. Go to Yast and execute the tool: Execution Level editor. Select PostgreSQL 
  and check levels 3 and 5, select start and check it's started.</p>
<p>Loign as posgresql and type:</p>
<p>createuser yourloginname</p>
<p>You will be asked, let the user create databases and optionally users.</p>
<p>Now you are a postgresql database user, we will create a database:</p>
<p>Login as yourloginname and type:</p>
<p>createdb test</p>
<p>Still not finished, we must say PostgreSQL wich IP connections are able to 
  connect to the database server, by default all connections are closed.</p>
<p>Login as postgres and type, or edit with your favourite editor:</p>
<p>vim /var/pgdata/pg_hba.conf</p>
<p>Remove the # symbol from the line:</p>
<p>host all all 127.0.0.1 255.255.255.255 trust</p>
<p>Now we need to restart the postgresql service, go to Yast Execution Level Editor 
  and restart the service.</p>
<p>Login as yourloginname and create some data.</p>
<p>I executed pgaccess from a X-Window console to start a client application to 
  connect to database test, this application uses also TCP/IP, so it's usefull 
  to test a connection, other tools like createdb are not usefull to test connection 
  configuration because does not use TCP/IP.</p>
<p>Now we are sure PostgreSQL is up and running correctly.</p>
<p><strong>PosgreSQL with DBExpress</strong></p>
<p>Go to Report Manager connections configuration window, select PostgreSQL and 
  click add.</p>
<p>After configuring the hostname as localhost, the database name as test, and 
  placing login information (the same as your login) It does not work, a error 
  message is raised: library libsqlpg.so can not be found.</p>
<p>But the library is in the path, this is a problem with the vendor library, 
  lets see executing:</p>
<p>ldd libsqlpg.so</p>
<p>This commands shows a link to libpq.so.2, but in my system I have a library 
  libpq.so.3, I cross my fingers and expect libqt.so.3 be compatible with the 
  expected libpq.so.2.</p>
<p>Login as root and type:</p>
<p>ln -s /usr/lib/libpq.so.3 /usr/lib/libpq.so.2</p>
<p>This creates a symbolic link to the newer library, I think you can have problems 
  if you use features available only with the newer version. But it works ok.</p>
<p>For consistency we will create another link:</p>
<p>Login as root and type:</p>
<p>ln -s /usr/lib/libpq.so.3 /usr/lib/libpq.so</p>
<p><strong>PosgreSQL with Zeos</strong></p>
<p>Go to Report Manager connections configuration window, select ZeosLib and click 
  add.</p>
<p>Select protocol PostgreSQL, database as test, hostname as localhost and set 
  user_name and password, you can left the port to default 0.</p>
<p>It does not work but it says correctly the missing library: unable to find 
  libqp.so </p>
<p>Login as root and type:</p>
<p>ln -s /usr/lib/libpq.so.3 /usr/lib/libpq.so</p>
<p>Now it works. I created a report library to test functionallity but before 
  I executed from pgaccess:</p>
<p>CREATE DOMAIN BLOB as bytea</p>
<p><strong>PosgreSQL with DBExpress-OpenODBC</strong></p>
<p>After installing unixODBC to allow odbc connections to the database a script 
  must be executed.</p>
<p>Login as yourloginname and type:</p>
<p>psql -d test -f /usr/share/psqlodbc/odbc.sql</p>
<p>We need to create a ODBC data source.</p>
<p>I executed ODBCConfig (as root) and created a System DSN, to access databases 
  from other services you should add a System DSN instead a User DSN, for example 
  to access from Report Manager web server (that is executed from apache for example).</p>
<p>You must add a driver:</p>
<p>I setup Driver Name as POSGRESQL. Driver as /usr/lib/psqlodbc.so Setup as /usr/lib/unixODBC/libodbcpsqlS.so</p>
<p>Then add a System DSN and assign parameter values to each item, Database, UserName, 
  Password. Save configuration.</p>
<p>I execute qtodbctest to check the connection without success. I think /etc/unixODBC/odbc.ini 
  contains a setup configuration incorrect for this PostgreSQL version, again 
  a configuration nightmare, this was so simple as providing a odbc.ini sample 
  entry in the psqlodbc pacakage, but there is no documentation, oh yes documentation 
  about how to build the driver (make clean..) but none about how to install it.</p>
<p>This driver cannot be tested with Report Manager because it fails with basic 
  ODBC connections tests (qtodbctest). Note that in Suse 8.2 and Suse 7.3 the 
  ODBC driver for PostgreSQL worked without problems.</p>
<p><strong>MySQL</strong></p>
<p>Intallation is done using software package installation in Yast, intall mysql 
  package, then the service is activated using Execution Level Editor also in 
  Yast (select 3 and 5 execution levels).</p>
<p>Install also the client libraries, in this caso mysql-shared package contains 
  the libmysqlclient.so.12 libraries, mysql-client will be useful for installation 
  testing. </p>
<p>Login as yourloginname and type:</p>
<p>mysqlshow</p>
<p>It will show you the database test.</p>
<p>I installed mysqlcc, a usefull client tool. Note that by default you must not 
  enter any password when connecting to mysql, that is to access your database 
  server connecting with mysqlcc set Host Name as localhost, User name as yourloginname 
  and blank password. It will connect and show you databases, I created a test 
  table an populated it.</p>
<p><strong>Zeos and MySQL</strong></p>
<p>Open Report Manager dataacess configuration, select ZeosLib and click add, 
  select a connection name, select the new connection, set Database Protocol to 
  mysql, Host Name to localhost, Database to test, User_Name to yourloginname 
  and important, blank password, Suse 9 default installation is with blank passwords 
  for MySQL.</p>
<p>When you click Test connection, a error is raised: libmysqlclient.so not found. 
  To solve the problem you must provide a symbolink link to the correct version 
  of MySQL client library.</p>
<p>Login as root and type:</p>
<p>ln -s /usr/lib/libmysqlclient.so.12 /usr/lib/libmysqlclient.so</p>
<p>Retry your connection with yourloginname user. Now it works ok.</p>
<p><strong>DBExpress and MySQL</strong></p>
<p>Open Report Manager dataacess configuration, select MySQL and click add, select 
  a connection name, select the new connection, Host Name to localhost, Database 
  to test, User_Name to yourloginname and important, blank password, Suse 9 default 
  installation is with blank passwords for MySQL.</p>
<p>If you test the connection a error is raised: libmysqlclient.so not found.</p>
<p>Login as root and type:</p>
<p>ln -s /usr/lib/libmysqlclient.so.12 /usr/lib/libmysqlclient.so</p>
<p>But still the same error is launched, this is because DBExpress find a diferent 
  version of the driver not supported by the DBExpress driver. You need a previous 
  version of the client library for example libmysqlclient.so.10 search it at 
  google for example and install in your system, to be persistent about the libmysqlclient.so 
  is the latest edit your dbxdrivers file in ~/.borland and set vendor lib to 
  of mysql driver to libmysqlclient.so.10. Now you are using a different client 
  library. This is a bit dangerous because you are using a wrong client library, 
  but should work.</p>
<p><strong>DBExpress OpenODBC and MySQL</strong></p>
<p>Installation of MySQL odbc driver is needed. You must install package MyODBC-unixODBC.</p>
<p>You can read the documentation provided (you can see the files of the package 
  executing rpm -ql MyODBC-unixODBC)</p>
<p>After the installation you can add to /etc/unixODBC/odbcinst.ini file this 
  section:</p>
<p>[myodbcdriver]</p>
<p>Description = MySQL ODBC Driver</p>
<p>Driver = /usr/lib/unixODBC/libmyodbc.so</p>
<p>And add to /etc/unixODBC/odbc.ini this section:</p>
<p>[myodbc]</p>
<p>Driver=myodbcdriver</p>
<p>Description= Test of DSN for MySQL</p>
<p>SERVER=localhost</p>
<p>PORT=</p>
<p>USER=yourloginname</p>
<p>PASSWORD=</p>
<p>Database=test</p>
<p>OPTION=3</p>
<p>Now you can test the connection with qtodbctest (remember, blank password and 
  yourloginname). Full connection must be correct.</p>
<p>Open Report Manager dataacess configuration, select OpenODBC and click add, 
  select a connection name, select the new connection, and set Database to myodbc 
  (the DSN name) the User_name to yourloginname and blank password.</p>
<p>In this case the test connection failed (the driver hangs), so a bug report 
  to OpenODBC driver project should be posted</p>
<p><strong>Firebird</strong></p>
<p>Intallation is done downloading the sofware from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/firebird" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/firebird</a></p>
<p>Login as root and type</p>
<p>rpm -U FirebirdSS-1.5.0.4027-RC7.i686.rpm</p>
<p>Then use Execution Level editor to startup the server and activate at runlevels 
  3 and 5.</p>
<p>To check installation:</p>
<p>We create a directory for databases, giving privileges only to firebird user:</p>
<p>mkdir /var/data</p>
<p>chown firebird /var/data</p>
<p>cd /opt/firebird/bin</p>
<p>./isql -user SYSDBA -password masterkey</p>
<p>CREATE DATABASE '/var/data/test.fdb';</p>
<p>quit;</p>
<p>Now test connection:</p>
<p>./isql -user SYSDBA -password masterkey localhost:/var/data/test.fdb</p>
<p>Login as yourloginname:</p>
<p>To create some I used IBAccess (<a href="http://www.ibaccess.org" target="_blank">http://www.ibaccess.org</a>), 
  after downloading:</p>
<p>tar zxvf ibaccess-1_18.i386.tar.gz</p>
<p>./ibaccess.sh</p>
<p>A symbolink link must be created because this tool uses Interbase Express, 
  this link is also necessary to work with Interbase Express driver in Report 
  Manager.</p>
<p>Login as root and type:</p>
<p>ln -s /usr/lib/libfbclient.so /usr/lib/libgds.so.0</p>
<p>Now you can use ibaccess to create a test table.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Firebird using Interbase Express</strong></p>
<p>You must generate a symbolic link to enable Interbase Express:</p>
<p>Login as root and type:</p>
<p>ln -s /usr/lib/libfbclient.so /usr/lib/libgds.so.0</p>
<p>Now you can create a connection and set the type to IBX. Configure the connection 
  in the same way as a DBExpress Interbase connection.Set database to localhost:/var/data/test.fdb 
  and it's working.</p>
<p><strong>Firebird using DBExpress</strong></p>
<p>You must generate a symbolic link to enable Interbase Express:</p>
<p>Login as root and type:</p>
<p>ln -s /usr/lib/libfbclient.so /usr/lib/libgds.so</p>
<p>Now you can create a connection and set parameters for that connection. Set 
  database to localhost:/var/data/test.fdb and it's working.</p>
<p><strong>Firebird using Zeos</strong></p>
<p>Open Report Manager dataacess configuration, select ZeosLib and click add, 
  select a connection name, select the new connection, set Database Protocol to 
  Firebird-1.5, Host Name to localhost, Database to /var/data/test.fdb, User_Name 
  to SYSDBA and password to masterkey.</p>
<p>When you click Test connection, a error is raised: fbclient.so not found. To 
  solve the problem you must provide a symbolink link to the correct version of 
  Firebird client library.</p>
<p>Login as root and type:</p>
<p>ln -s /usr/lib/libfbclient.so /usr/lib/fbclient.so</p>
<p>Retry your connection, now it works ok.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle and DBExpress </strong>(by Stefano Tronu -stefano.tronu@gmail.com)</p>

  2) Installing ReportManager (for example on /opt/repmand)<br>
  3) verify if the Oracle VendorLib name on /root/.borland/dbxdriver is<br>
  the same of libclntsh.so* under lib root oracle installation. If is<br>
  not the same, create a link to the .so library or rename the VendorLib<br>
  name under dbxdriver. (for example, Oracle10g library name is<br>
  libclntsh.so.10.1).<br>
  4) Copy the TNSNAMES.ORA contents into the databasename connections<br>
  configuration, for example<br>
  &quot;(DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS_LIST = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST =<br>
  hostname)(PORT = 1521)) )<br>
  (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVICE_NAME = ORATEST) ) )&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  On Linux is not a valid environment TNS_ADMIN=TNSNAMES.ORA path, so<br>
  is'n need create environment variables such as<br>
  ORACLE_HOME, ORACLE_SID, LD_LIBRARY_PATH and TNS_ADMIN.<br>
