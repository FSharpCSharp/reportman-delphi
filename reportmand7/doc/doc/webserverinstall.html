<h2>Report Manager Web Server</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p><b>Installing Report Manager web server in Microsoft IIS 5</b></p>
<p>Usually you copy the application (rpwebserver.dll) into a directory with privileges 
  to execute binary files.</p>
<p>Open the Internet Information Services administration tool, create a directory 
  (cgi-bin) and alter properties to allow executing applications.</p>

<p><img src="images/webserverinstall2.jpg" width="461" height="465"></p>
<p>You can test the installation by calling the application with /version command:</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/repwebserver.dll/version">http://localhost/cgi-bin/repwebserver.dll/version</a></p>
<p>This will give you info about the configuration file the report web server 
  is using, including the location of the configuration file.</p>
<p>For security reasons you can't add/remove users or aliases from the web. To 
  configure users and aliases you can use repserverapp(xp) and repserverconfig(xp), 
  execute repserverapp as a privileged user (root or Admin) so it opens the system 
  wide configuration file and have write permissions over it, then execute repserverconfig(xp) 
  and add aliases and users. You can see the generated file location in reportserverapp 
  form, this configuration file will be used by the web report server.</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/repwebserver.dll/login">http://localhost/cgi-bin/repwebserver.dll/login</a></p>
<p>Some tricks will help you otsetup the web server:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Make sure the user executing Internet Information Services have read privileges 
    for the directories containing reports</li>
  <li>After changing some configuration make sure to restart Internet Information 
    Services or else use repwebexe.exe instead of repwebserver.dll</li>
  <li>If an error about dbxdrivers appear copy dbxdrivers.ini and dbxconnections.ini 
    files to the path the error<br>
    indicates. </li>
  <li>Check the permissions of the above files for the user executing IIS.</li>
  <li>If your machine is a multiprocessor machine or a hyperthreading technology 
    machine may be rebwebexe.exe will give you the better performance (instead 
    the ISAPI repwebserver.dll)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Installing Report Manager web server in Linux Apache</b></p>
<p>Usually you copy the application (rpwebexe.bin and repwebexe) into a directory 
  with execution privileges, in Suse 7.3, is /usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin.</p>
<p>You must place the configuration file of the server in /etc/reportmanserver 
  file. You can generate it with the <a href="serverserver.html">tcp server application</a> 
  and the <a href="serverconfig.html">tcp server configuration</a>. </p>
<p>This file will contain user information (default user Admin with blank password) 
  and the report directories. A simple file can be:</p>
<p>[ALIASES]</p>
<p>SAMPLE=/var/reports</p>
<p>User running apache process must have read privileges of this directory.</p>
<p>The database configuration files must be placed in directory /usr/local/etc, 
  this files are:</p>
<p>dbxconnections.conf, dbxdrivers.conf</p>
<p>There information about database location, user names and passwords are stored, 
  if you use the designer application (repmand) it usually reads and writes this 
  configuration files to /home/username/.borland directory, you can copy the files 
  from there to the correct directory.</p>
<p>Finally the report server application must link to required libraries, you 
  should place this libs (provided with the report designer) in /opt/kylixlibs 
  directory, because repwebexe.bin application launcher add this directory to 
  the path, otherwise you can add other directory to /etc/ld.so.conf file and 
  run ldconfig command.</p>
<p>To test the server you can write:</p>
<p>http://localhost/cgi-bin/repwebexe.bin/version</p>
<p>It will say you the version and the configuration file location, then you can 
  test the configured reports:</p>
<p>http://localhost/cgi-bin/repwebexe.bin/login</p>
<h4>Thousand separator and other locales</h4>
<p>Most linux distros use a diferent locale for apache, you can check environment 
  variables with the /version command and see the resulting decimal separator, 
  thousand separator etc, you can override it by placing for example a .htaccess 
  file in cgi-bin directory where repwebexe is placed, with this content:</p>
<p>SetEnv KYLIX_DEFINEDENVLOCALES yes<br>
  SetEnv KYLIX_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR .<br>
  SetEnv KYLIX_DECIMAL_SEPARATOR ,<br>
  SetEnv KYLIX_DATE_SEPARATOR /<br>
  SetEnv KYLIX_TIME_SEPARATOR :</p>
<h4>Using a log file to track web report server activity</h4>
<p>You can specify a log file to write information about executed reports. To 
  enable the log file edit your configuration file and insert:</p>
<p>[CONFIG]</p>
<p>LOGFILE=/var/log/reportmanweb.txt</p>
<p>Make sure the user executing repwebexe application inside Apache or IIS has 
  write privileges over this file.</p>
<h4>Serve customized html files</h4>
<p></p>
<p>To serve alternative html files, you must configure where the html files are 
  and use the replacement strings contained in the models. You will find the html 
  original files (models) in the cvs development tree. </p>
<p>To configure place in the configuration file</p>
<p>[CONFIG]</p>
<p>PAGESDIR=c:\inetpub\wwwroot\reportserver</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Configuring environment variables in Apache using Oracle</b></p>
<p>You can pass environment varaibles to any cgi with apache, for example oracle 
  needed ones. </p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
  PassEnv directive<br>
  Syntax: PassEnv env-variable [env-variable] ...<br>
  Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess<br>
  Override: FileInfo<br>
  Status: Base<br>
  Module: mod_env<br>
  Compatibility: PassEnv is only available in Apache 1.1 and later. <br>
  Directory and .htaccess context is available in Apache 1.3.7 and <br>
  later. <br>
  Specifies one or more environment variables to pass to CGI scripts <br>
  and SSI pages from the environment of the shell which invoked the <br>
  httpd process. Example:</p>
<p> PassEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH<br>
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
  In addition: You must set the Oracle environment <br>
  (ORACLE_HOME,PATH,LD_LIBRARY_PATH) inside the init httpd script <br>
  (/etc/init.d/httpd) plus add the following directives inside the <br>
  configuration file /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:<br>
  PassEnv ORACLE_HOME<br>
  PassEnv PATH<br>
  PassEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH</p>
<p>To generate advanced graphics (charts) you must use the alternative repwebexex.<br>
The apache server service must start in runlevel 5, and the Xserver must be running.<br>
The environment variable DISPLAY must be defined to :0 in he apache runtime.<br>
Some security settigs should be disabled, the fastest way is to disable the firewall and then execute the comand to enable access to the Xserver: xhost +<br>
