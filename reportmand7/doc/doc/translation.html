<h3>Translating Report Manager to other languages</h3>
<p>Report Manager supports automatic internacionalization and localization it 
  will show the forms in the language selected by the user, that is LANG enviroment 
  variable in Linux or Regional configuration in Microsoft Windows. This is only 
  possible if you provide the translated resourcestring file for the selected 
  language, if you don't provide it then the english language is selected.</p>
<p>The resource file is reportmanres.*, where * means the user selected language, 
  for example reportmanres.es for Spanish based languages. The engine will search 
  this file in the current dir so you must provide them when deploying your applications 
  or Report Manager Designer.</p>
<p>To translate the resourcestrings you must download the translation kit (for 
  now only supports Microsoft Windows, but the translated file is platform independent), 
  it includes rptranslate.exe.</p>
<p>You must execute rptranslate.exe, open the reportmanres.en file located at 
  Report Manager Designer directory and save as reportman.* where * is the destination 
  language, then you can begin the translation. You can see a list of languages 
  and their extensions, you must get the first two letters of the extension.</p>

<p>You can translate the translator itself using the same procedure with rptranslateres.en 
  file.</p>
<p>If you don't know your language extension you can examine the avaliable extensions 
  using the Language information item in utilities menu.</p>
