<h3>Database connections</h3>
<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>This is a collection that describes the properties of each database connection 
  used in the report. The items of this collection are edited in the designer 
  in the <b>data configuration dialog</b>. </p>
<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>Each item describes a connection, based on a database connection driver.</p>

            Manager components and want to add the support in compilation (Kylix/Builder/Delphi)
