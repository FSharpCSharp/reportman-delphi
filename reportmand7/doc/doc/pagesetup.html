<h2>Basic report design</h2>
<h3><b>Page setup and print options</b></h3>
<p>To alter report page setup go to page setup option in file menu.</p>
<p>If you left <b>page size</b> Default, the engine will not select any page size 
  before printing, that is will use the default system page size, you can select 
  a predefined page size or define a new one (only Windows supports custom page 
  sizes with<a href="knownissues.html"> limitations</a>). </p>
<p>If you left <b>page orientation</b> Default, the enine will not select any 
  page orientation before printing, that is will use the default system page orientation.</p>
<p>You can configure the report to a specific page size, and also force printer 
  orientation, the default is use current configured printer page and orientation.</p>

<p><b>Language property</b> allow you to design the report to print it in multiple 
  languages, the language property only affect labels, you design the report in 
  english, then switch to another language, and modify labels, before printing 
  you can switch language from Report Manager Designer and Report Manager components 
  in Delphi/Kylix/Builder (language property).</p>
<p><b>Printer Fonts property</b> allow Microsoft Windows platform the option to 
  use printer fonts in dot matrix printers so the report will be printed in Native 
  Printer fonts, with the best precision and speed. To do so you must install 
  the correct driver for the selected printer, or the printer driver that the 
  physical printer is emulating via Hardware. </p>
<p>Note: To print in Linux in fast test mode you can install the ps2ascii as a 
  filter in your printer spooler. If you have some sample of doing it, please 
  e-mail me so I can include it in documentation.</p>
<p><b>Two Pass Report</b> property allow to know additional information about 
  the report before printing the first page, if you select this, you can use the 
  <b>pagecount</b> function to obtain the total number of pager of the report. 
  If this option is set, the report will be calculated entirely, then printed. 
  It can consume more system resources and the preview is slower because the entire 
  report is calculated before the engine show the first page.</p>
<p><strong>Duplex and paper source</strong> is implemented only for Microsoft 
  Windows, allow the selection of a paper source (print drawer source) and enable 
  duplex (two side) print on printers having this feature (usually high volume 
  laser printers).</p>
<p><b>Page margins</b> are used as the origin for printing sections, bottom margin 
  limits the space used in the bottom of the page, and right margin limits the 
  space used to the right of the page that is when printing horizontally (labels 
  for example).</p>
<p><strong>Prefered save format</strong> change the way the report is stored to 
  file, you can select plain text to save the report definition as text and track 
  changes with some version control system, to obtain a smaller file but not human 
  readable select zlib compressed.</p>
<p><b>Printer selection</b></p>
<p>You can force the report to select a specified printer. There are predefined 
  printer configuration names, and each printer configuration name can be linked 
  to a system installed printer, it's also useful to determine wich printer will 
  use devicefonts (Windows only) and to fine adjust the position of the page in 
  the physical page.</p>
<p>By selecting system configuration you force all users use a single configuration 
  (you must be root in Linux or Administrator in Windows).</p>
<p>Printer selection in Windows has some issues, see <a href="knownissues.html">known 
  issues and workarounds</a>.</p>
