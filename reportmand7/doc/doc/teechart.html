<h2>Advanced report design</h2>
<h3>TeeChart support</h3>

<p>The chart component of Report Manager engine has a Driver property, you can 
  select the desired driver, the default driver will choose the best available
  driver, that is TeeChart if you enabled it.</p>
<h4>Enabling TeeChart</h4>
<p>If you compile the engine, by default does not enable TeeCharts. To enable TeeChart you must
  modify rpconf.inc file and enable it:</p>
<p>{$DEFINE USETEECHART}</p>
<p> TeeChart is a powerful component included in Delphi (Windows, TeeChart standard
  edition) since early versions. Unfortunatelly, TeeChart is not provided in Kylix.</p>
<p>You can purchase TeeChart Pro from <a href="http://www.steema.com" target="_blank">Steema
  corporation</a>, it's also available for Kylix.</p>
<h4>TeeChart limitations</h4>
<p>When you enable TeeChart compilation, the engine uses VCL TeeChart version
  in Windows (Delphi), and CLX version in Kylix. You must recompile all the packages
  because TeeChart introduces new dependences to the base package, so after enabling
  TeeChart, you can't use the Report Manager engine without an X Server running
  in Linux.</p>
<p>Many of the properties of the chart component of the Report Manager engine
  are related only to TeeChart (perspective, rotation..), the native chart driver
  only support lines, but it's very fast and don't have any CLX or VCL dependences
  (ideal for console or web applications). </p>
<p>TeeChart generates bitmaps in a selected bitmap resolution, so they are stored as
  a bitmap inside the processed report (pdf or metafile), it's not vectorized,
  and the generated report can be bigger and slower to print.</p>
<p>TeeChart is enabled in provided binaries, the exception are printreptopdf
  and repwebexe commmand line tools because they don't need a X-Server running,
  if you want to display <b>beautiful charts you need to enable TeeChart</b>.</p>
