<h2>Advanced report design</h2>
<h3><b>Form filling and printing</b></h3>
<p>This is a small guide to perform preprinted form filling. Usually you have 
  a form, in printed format, or pdf and you want to fill values in boxes provided 
  by this form.</p>
<h3>1. Obtaining the background image</h3>
<p>The background image will be placed in one section of our report so we can 
  place items, expressions, labels on top of it.</p>
<p>If the form is <strong>already printed</strong>, you should <strong>use a image 
  scanner</strong> to obtain the background image, check the dots per inch property 
  of the scanner, you will place the same value in dpi property in the section 
  you place the image.</p>
<p>If the form is provided as pdf you should use a tool to convert it to a image 
  file, each page must be a separate image file, you will get a good result using 
  Adobe Acrobat 6 professional.</p>
<p>Usually the best image format for the background image is a Windows Bitmap 
  format, 8 bit color depth (indexed), if the report have the property prefered 
  save format set to binary/zlib, the bitmap will be stored in compressed format, 
  make sure to check this property before adding the background images.</p>
<p>If the images are real life photos the best compression can be acchieved with 
  jpeg format.</p>
<h3>2. Place items</h3>
<p>After setting the background image property, you can drag &amp; drop fields 
  on top of the image, the background image can appear also in preview or also 
  printed, checking the background style. You should set page margins to 0 if 
  you scanned or exported the whole image.</p>
<p>Here is a sample:</p>
<p><img src="images/formfill1.jpg" width="891" height="551"></p>
<h3>4. Final adjustments</h3>
<p>By adjusting margins you can adjust output, if your want to print also the 
  background you don't need adjustments.</p>
<p>A sample result:</p>
<p><img src="images/formfill2.jpg" width="459" height="551"></p>
<p>This sample report is also configured to generate a <a href="customoutput.html">custom 
  text output</a> to be used to pay to Agencia Tributaria (Spain) using Internet 
  method (&quot;presentaci&oacute;n telem&aacute;tica&quot;). </p>
