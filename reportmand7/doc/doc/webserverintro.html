<h2>Report Manager Web Server</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Report Manager Web Server is a multithread application that works together 
  with a web server application. It allows any number of HTML client machines 
  to execute reports obtaining <b>ready to print Adobe PDF files</b>.</p>
<p>The web report server will ask user name and password, then show any available 
  report groups, and any <b>report in each group</b>, <b>allowing to change report 
  parameters</b> before executing the report, all is done via HTML and <b>without 
  the need of enabling Cookies in the client browser</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The client machine only need a Html Browser, if the browser have an Adobe PDF 
  file viewer plugin, the user will see the report in the screen, else the user 
  can save the resulting file and proces it with any tool like <b>pdf2ps or with 
  Adobe PDF Reader</b>.</p>
<p>The web report server supports Linux (Apache) and Windows (apache 2-Microsoft 
  IIS 5).</p>
<p>See<a href="webserverinstall.html"> Installation instructions</a> for more 
  information.</p>
<p>The web report sever must have any database drivers required by available reports, 
  optionally the web server can be also be the database server, but the database 
  server can be any machine accesible by the report server machine, so you can 
  distribute the work of generated reports, for example the report client can 
  be a Internet enabled machine running any operating system, requesting a report 
  from a far network, the server generates the report requesting process intensive 
  querys to a high performance database server, after the calculation of the report 
  is done, the server sends the result to the client machine.</p>
<p>The web server is optimized to use very little bandwith.</p>
<p><b>Configuration</b></p>
<p>See<a href="webserverinstall.html"> Installation instructions</a> for configuration 
  information.</p>
<p></p>
<p>See <a href="webserveroperations.html">web server operations</a> page for operation 
  options, basically you can operate the web server passing parameters in the 
  URL.</p>
<p>By default there is only one user named Admin and without password, in the 
  report web server Admin user can't do administration tasks.</p>
<p><b>Other considerations</b></p>
<p>When you design reports for use with web report server you must configure them 
  to be thread safe, that is make sure your driver supports multithread (as far 
  as I know all drivers supports this) and your database connection string is 
  thread safe, for example to access Interbase/Firebird databases provide the 
  always the hostname (or write localhost), so the access method to the database 
  is thread safe (local access method is not thread safe).</p>
<p>Also you should define parameters, and the report should be a separate independent 
  entity that only requires user parameters to execute.</p>
