<h2>Advanced report design</h2>
<h3><b>In memory datasets</b></h3>
<p>There is a special database driver, <strong>Mybase</strong>, that will allow 
  the use of in memory datasets.</p>
<p>The features of this driver are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read the dataset from a file a Mybase binary or XML formatted file (created 
    by TClientDataset component from Borland tools)</li>
  <li>Read the dataset from a plain text file, with the help of a field definition 
    file, this files are usually files with one line for each row and fixed size 
    fields. There is a wizard no create the field definition file.</li>
  <li>Sort the dataset by any field, with the <strong>Index Fields property</strong> 
    you specify the fields separated by ; symbol (CUSTNO;ORDERNO for example).</li>
  <li>Get the records from any other already defined dataset. You use the UNIONS 
    list to specify which datasets will be used to fill the in memory dataset, 
    if you select more than one dataset, the numer of fields and field types must 
    be the same.</li>
  <li>Group the union, by selecting union grouping, the in memory dataset will 
    by grouped by the fields specified in the Index Fields property.</li>
  <li>Stablish master detail relationships, this is a filter based on fields of 
    another dataset. Use the <strong>Master Fields property combined with Index 
    Fields</strong> property to perform field relation equivalences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sample</strong></p>
<p>Imagine we are reporting sales by customer but very detailed. We will use a 
  subreport with a group, customer number, the trick is that at the group header 
  <strong>we want to print total by customer</strong>, so expression evaluator 
  sums will not work.</p>
<p>You can solve the problem by using linked querys, but this linked query will 
  be executed each time a CUSTNO changes in the main dataset, if there are 200 
  customers, 201 querys will be executed (once for each custno and the main query).</p>
<p>To enhace performance we will execute 2 querys one for the detail and another 
  for all totals by customer.</p>
<p>1.Create a database connection.<br>
  2.Create a MyBase connection.</p>
<p>DETAIL dataset with database connection with the sql:<br>
  SELECT CUSTNO,ARTNO,QTY,PRICE,AMOUNT FROM SALES ORDER BY CUSTNO</p>
<p>TOTALS dataset with database connectoin with the sql<br>
  SELECT CUSTNO,SUM(AMOUNT) AS AMOUNT FROM SALES GROUP BY CUSTNO</p>
<p>No datasource needed, both querys will be executed only once to enhace performanc 
  and<br>
  net bandwith.</p>
<p>Now to show the correct grand total (TOTALS.AMOUNT) for each customer at the 
  group header:</p>
<p>INMEMTOTAL dataset with MyBase connection, UNION the TOTALS datset.<br>
  IndexFields CUSTNO<br>
  Datasource DETAIL, MasterFields CUSTNO.</p>
<p>Master fields relates to field names in DETAIL, that will be used with IndexFields 
  to perform a filter in<br>
  INMEMTOTAL dataset. In this case the filter will result in only one row, but 
  it's not limited in any way.</p>
<p>For example a INMEMORY DATASET can contain lot of rows and the filter can reduce 
  the result set:<br>
  IndexFields: CUSTNO;ORDERNO<br>
  MasterFields: CUSTNO</p>
