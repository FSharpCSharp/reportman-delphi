<h3>Integrating the report in Delphi/Kylix</h3>
<p>To integrate the report in Delphi/Kylix you must install first the correct 
  packages, refer to documentation in <a href="../doc/kylixcomp.html">Kylix</a> 
  and <a href="../doc/delphicomp.html">Delphi</a>.</p>
<p>New components appear in the palette (reportman section) wherefrom most important 
  is the TCLXReport component.</p>

<p>To pass custom opened datasets (any dataaccess engine with a TDataset descendant 
  like Zeos, Direct Oracle Access...) to the reporting engine you can use the 
  AliasList property in TCLXReport and a TRpAlias component that establishes relations 
  between aliases and Application datasets.</p>
<p>Drop the TNewCLXReport to a form and select a report by clicking the button 
  beside the Filename property. You can select also the preview property and the 
  tittle.</p>
