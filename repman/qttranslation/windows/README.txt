eZ linguist for Windows

This archive contains Qt Linguist 1.0, the patched lupdate and lrelease
("eZ linguist"), and the Qt 3.0.4 DLL.
Copy the DLL in your system32 folder, for example:
C:\windows\system32
C:\winnt\system32
or any other place where DLLs are located on your system.
Copy the programs to wherever you want them to be.
Important: lupdate and lrelease are console programs.
They must be run from your command prompt (DOS shell).
You must add a reference to them
in your PATH environment variable, or Windows won't be able to find them.
If you don't know how to set your PATH, copy lupdate and lrelease to
C:\windows or C:\winnt (depending on your system). This folder is always
in the PATH.
