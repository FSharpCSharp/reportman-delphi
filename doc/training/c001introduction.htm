<h1>Chapter 1 - Introduction</h1>
<h2>1.1.What is Report Manager?</h2>
<p>Report Manager is a printable document generation engine. The resulting documents 
  are usually based on database stored data, maybe printed, previewed or save 
  to different file formats (Adobe PDF, HTML.). This task is commonly called by 
  software developers as reporting.</p>
<p>The engine take a report scheme (also called report definition) as input, connect 
  and retrieve data from database/s (if necessary) and generate output document 
  to printer or to different file formats.</p>
<p>This is a scheme of the process:</p>

<p>You can create and modify Report definition files with the Report Designer, 
  the report files are processed by the engine connecting to databases, and a 
  output driver is selected to generate output.</p>
<p>Currently Report Manager runs on Microsoft Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003 
  operating systems and most Linux based systems (I386 based).</p>
<h2>1.2.Report Schemes, the report designer</h2>
<p>There is a Report Designer to define report schemes, this report schemes are 
  usually stored in files, with .rep extension, but can be also stored inside 
  databases (report library).</p>

<p>The report designer can execute (process) the report scheme to generate print 
  out, preview and other output.</p>

  1.3.Report Metafile, a native format</h2>
<p>The output for a processed report can be the printer, the screen, an Adobe 
  PDF file and others. There is a special output format, native to Report Manager 
  engine, called report metafile, with .rpmf extension.</p>
<p>A report metafile is a file containing the information to print and preview 
  the entire final document, it's like a PDF file but with a much simpler internal 
  design, it's designed to be very small. </p>
<p>You can export to metafile from the preview window clicking the disk icon.</p>
<p>Report Manager includes a report metafile viewer, also advanced features like 
  net report server use report metafiles in communication process. Metafiles are 
  very useful to software developers.</p>

<h2><br>
  1.4.Report Manager for developers</h2>
<p>Report Manager include software integration tools, so you can use the engine 
  in a easy way from your own software applications.</p>
<p>An ActiveX control is provided for any tool that supports this technology.</p>
<p>Command line tools and a shared library are also provided for external calls 
  or to run batch processes.</p>

<p>For Borland Delphi/Builder/Kylix, native component installation can be used 
  for better integration.</p>

<h2>1.5.Advanced features</h2>
<p>Report Manager include other advanced tools.</p>
<p><strong>Net Report Server</strong></p>
<p>Net Report server is a server application or Windows service that allow thin 
  report client to browse and execute any report in the server, the only thing 
  needed on the client computer is the report client (metaviewxp.exe).</p>
<p><strong>Web Report Server</strong></p>
<p>Web Report server is a standalone cgi application installable in any CGI compatible 
  web server (Microsoft IIS, Apache...). By using a URL from a Internet browser, 
  the report is executed and retrieved to the client computer with zero previous 
  configuration on it.</p>
<h2>1.A. Exercise. Installation</h2>
<p>Download and install Report Manager software to your computer. You can use 
  the link http://reportman.sourceforge.net or install an already downloaded Report 
  Manager installation wizard program.</p>
<h2>1.B. Exercise. Execution</h2>
<p>Open Report Designer, open the sample provided: sample4.rep, and execute the 
  report (preview on file menu). Take a look on the scheme and result, on preview 
  test the disk icon to export the report to other formats.</p>
<h2>1.C. Exercise. Report Scheme file format</h2>
<p>Use notepad application to open the file sample4.rep, examine the file structure, 
  it's not necessary you understand all the contents, just try to find elements 
  you see in designer inside the file. Note that altering the file manually may 
  convert the file on a non readable report scheme.</p>
<h2>1.D. Exercise. Report metafile format</h2>
<p>Open Report Manager designer again, open sample4.rep file, preview it and save 
  the result as a metafile (.rpmf). Open Report Manager metafile viewer, and open 
  the metafile you created. Inside metafile viewer application you can export 
  the metafile to other formats.</p>
