<h2>Basic report design</h2>
<h3><b>Designer Preferences</b></h3>
<p>Designer preferences are not stored for each report, but for each machine or 
  user where Report Manager Designer is installed.</p>
<p>You can switch between centimeters and inchess measurement units:</p>
<p><img src="images/preferences.jpg" width="610" height="401"></p>
<p>Note that the measurement properties of items and sections are expressed in 
  the unit you select here.</p>
<p>In Microsoft Windows you can select to print using Qt/CLX library or GDI/VCL 
  library (a report definition is platform and device independent).</p>
<p>Here is a table of differences between the drivers:</p>

<p>Usually Windows GDI performs better drawing features and precision (with a 
  good device driver), but it's not cross platform.</p>
<p>When you print/preview using GDI driver you are obtaining the same result as 
  using TVCLReport Delphi/Builder component.</p>
<p>When you print/prevew using Qt driver you are obtaining the same result as 
  using TCLXDriver.</p>
<p><b>Qt System print dialog</b></p>
<p>Selecting this option (default) the print dialog is the Qt system print dialog 
  in Linux and Windows print dialog in Windows, if you disable this option a custom 
  Report Manager engine is shown.</p>
<p><b>Status Bar</b></p>
<p>Selecting this option (default) the status bar is shown. You can obtain a little 
  more workspace disabling the status bar.</p>
<p><b>Qt Widget Style</b></p>
<p>Qt widget style is set initially to default, so in Microsoft Windows the widget 
  appearance is the same as Windows 9x/NT/Millenium/2000 but in Linux the widget 
  style is the default system widget style (usually windows).</p>
<p>You can select the widget style you like, it will be remembered by Report Manager 
  Designer, here are two samples:</p>
