<h2>Report Manager Server</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Report Manager Server is a multithread service/application that works over 
  TCP/IP protocol. It allows any number of client machines to execute reports 
  obtaining ready to print report metafiles.</p>
<p>You must start the server application (available also as a service) in the 
  server machine, in the server machine you should have database connectivity 
  software so the reports can execute on it.</p>
<p>The database server can be any machine accesible by the report server machine, 
  so you can distribute the work of generating reports, for example the report 
  client can be a Internet enabled connection requesting a report to a far network 
  (also connected to Internet) server, the server generates the report requesting 
  process intensive querys to a high performance database server, after the calculation 
  of the report is done, the server sends the result to the report client.</p>
<p>The report client application can request information about parameters and 
  also alter them before executing the report.</p>
<p>The server and the client are optimized to use very little bandwith.</p>
<p>You can install the report server in a linux machine and execute report client 
  in MS Windows machines or vice-versa.</p>
<p><b>Configuration</b></p>
<p>Report Manager server runs using port 3060,you can run the server as an application 
  and see the report configuration and log files. You can alter all settings using 
  repserverconfig application except the port (you can alter it modifying the 
  configuration file).</p>
<p>By default there is only one user named Admin and without password. You can 
  assign a password to Admin user, and add other users. The Admin user is the 
  only one with privileges to add Report Server aliases.</p>
<p>A report alias is a name and a path that points to a directory that can contain 
  reports and directories containing reports so a report tree is generated using 
  the directory structure, the reports are stored in the server and the report 
  tree is send to the report client.</p>
<p><b>Other considerations</b></p>
<p>When you design reports for use with report server you must configure them 
  to be thread safe, that is make sure your driver supports multithread (as far 
  as I know all drivers supports this) and your database connection string is 
  thread safe, for example to access Interbase/Firebird databases provide the 
  always the hostname (or write localhost), so the access method to the database 
  is thread safe (local access method is not thread safe).</p>
