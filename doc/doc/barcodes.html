<h3>Barcode printing</h3>

<h4>Barcode limitations</h4>
<p>In Linux, the qt library (version 2.3) have only a resolution of 100dpi (dots 
  per inches) so with some printer drivers the barcodes printed are not readable, 
  that is because the rectangles of the barcode are slightly bad positioned because 
  this low resolution. If you export the report to Adobe PDF format and print 
  them using Adobe Acrobat Reader you will obtain better quality. You can try 
  to use other printer driver or change the module of the barcode (size of the 
  narrowest rectangle). You can also try to install latest CUPS drivers, it's 
  reported to work better.</p>
<p><b>Barcodes supported and comments</b>:</p>

  <tr> 
    <td><b>Type</b></td>
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <p>bcCode_2_5_interleaved, bcCode_2_5_industrial, bcCode_2_5_matrix, bcCodeITF14</p>
    </td>
    <td>2 of 5 code family, supports all properties, this code allow an unlimited 
      number of digits</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>bcCode39, bcCode39Extended</td>
      <td>Code39 Family, supports all properties, this code allow an unlimited 
        number of alphanumeric characters, the barcode with is wider than other 
        that only supports digits, if Calc.Checksum is set an additional character 
        checksum is added, the start and stop characters (*) are automatically 
        added. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>bcCode128A, bcCode128B, bcCode128C, bcCode128</td>
    <td> 
      <p>Code 128 family, A and B allow alphanumeric coding, the B allow also 
        lowercase chars. The C allow only numeric values but gerenerates the narrowest 
        barcode. The bcCode128 generates a B and C mixed barcode, full optimized, 
        so a code like 234534AB generates a 128C segment and a 128B segment, so 
        the barcode is 50% smaller than using 128B.</p>
      <p>To generate EAN128 valid codes you must use the application fields and 
        separator digits, you can use the 102 code or any char with a ascii code 
        greater than 102 to represent a separator digit, a EAN128 code always 
        begins with a separator, a sample:</p>
      <p>#102+'10896021'+#102+'21456738XABT'</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>bcCode93, bcCode93Extended</td>
    <td>Code93 family, alphanumeric barcodes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>bcCodeMSI</td>
    <td>MSI barcodes, only digits</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>bcCodePostNet</td>
    <td>Postnet barcode, only digits</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>bcCodeCodabar</td>
    <td>Codabar barcode, digits, and A..D letters and some simbols</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>bcCodeEAN8, bcCodeEAN13</td>
    <td>European EAN barcodes, the last digit is a checksum and can be calculated 
      if Calc.Checksum property is set</td>

<p><b>The Ratio property</b></p>
<p>Valid ratio values are between 2.0 and 3.0, except for 2_5_matrix between 2.25 
  and 3.0. Usually the ratio is 2.0 and it's adjusted to 2.25 on 2_5_matrix. Larger 
  the ratio value wider the barcode output.</p>
<p><b>Calc.Checksum property</b></p>
<p>Only has effect on EAN8,EAN13 and Code39 barcodes.</p>
<p><b>Modul</b></p>
<p>The Modul property is used to build the barcode as the size of the narrowest 
  bar. </p>
<p><b>Rotation property</b></p>
<p>You can rotate the barcode by a square angle, this property is in degrees.</p>
