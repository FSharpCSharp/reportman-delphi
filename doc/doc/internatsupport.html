<h2>Advanced Report Design</h2>
<h3><b>International support</b></h3>
<p><b>Multilanguage support</b></p>
<p>Report Manager supports multiple languages. You can place several labels with 
  the text written in one language, then go to page setup screen, change the language 
  and modigy each label to the selected language. The report will store all the 
  strings for the languages of the report.</p>
<p><b>Unicode support</b></p>
<p>Chinesse and other unicode languages</p>
<p>Report Manager supports unicode languages in windows (using GDI), preview and 
  print, linux is also supported via Qt libraries. Generation of PDF files is 
  not implemented for WideString languages.</p>
<p><b>Bidirectional text support (Hebrew and arabic languages)</b></p>
<p>Bidirectional support is enabled with the Bidi Mode property for all text components, 
  you can select:</p>
<table width="100%" border="1">
  <tr> 
    <td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><b>Value</b></td>
    <td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><b>Meaning</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>No Bidi</td>
    <td>No Bidirectional support</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td> Partial Bidi</td>
    <td>Left to right drawing, horizontal alignment is not changed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Full Bidi</td>
    <td>Left to right drawing, horizontal alignment is reversed</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>For a more detail description see <a href="bidi_behavior.html">Bidi Behaviour</a>.</p>
<p>The Bidi algorithm used is very simple in Linux and PDF output so text containing 
  numbers may be drawn incorrectly, with the Windows GDI driver the drawing is 
  done with Windows GDI and should be correct.</p>
