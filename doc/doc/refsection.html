<h3>Section properties</h3>
<p><b>Sumary</b></p>
<p>The sections are contained inside subreports, depending on the section type 
  it will print after the detail (group header), before the detail (group header), 
  or in special places (page headers and footers)</p>

    <td>Boolean</td>
    <td>When horizzontal desplacement is set to true, after printing the section 
      the print position will move to the left, in an amount equivalent to the 
      section width. But this will happen only when the next section to print 
      has also the horizontal desplacement set to true, else the horizontal print 
      position will be restored. Set this property to true in the detail section 
      for example to print labels left to right, adjust the section with so many 
      details fit in the total page width. See also <a href="labels.html">labels 
      documentation</a>.</td>

    <td>When vertical desplacement is set to true, the print is performed as usually 
      (up to down), after reaching the bottom of the page, the print position 
      will place at the top of the page (or group header) , and the left print 
      position will move an amount equivalent to the section with (if fits in 
      the page), then printing continue. But this will happen only when the next 
      section to print has also the vertical desplacement set to true, else the 
      engine will skip to next page. Set this property to true in the detail section 
      for example to print labels up to down, adjust the section with so many
