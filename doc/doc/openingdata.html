<h2>Basic report design</h2>
<h3><b>Opening the dataset</b></h3>
<p>To print a report you usually need a dataset, for example a list of customers, 
  employees, projects,.... This is not a requirement, you can design your report 
  without any database source.</p>
<p>The first step of report design procedure should be open the main dataset, 
  the engine will print the detail section (or sections) for each record in the 
  dataset. This happens for each subreport, you can have more than one subreport 
  or also child subreports.</p>
<p>In the sample we will use DBExpress driver to connect througth Interbase/Firebird 
  to the <b>sample database employee.gdb</b>.</p>
<p><img src="images/opendata.jpg" width="415" height="255"></p>
<p>A report have database connections and datasets, you must create first the 
  connection then add a dataset and set the properties like the SQL sentence.</p>
<p>We will add a <b>DBExpress </b> connection, you will have a list of available 
  connections, if you are using Delphi/Kylix/Builder development enviroments you 
  will see the same list you see in your development tool. See database access 
  troubleshooting for more information.</p>

<p>You must configure connection parameters, click 'Configure' button:</p>
<p><img src="images/opendata3.jpg" width="615" height="436"></p>
<p>By default all connections are shown, you must select the database driver before 
  adding a connection, select Interbase and click the add connection button, the 
  connection name must be the same as you defined in your connections window, 
  in this example the connection name will be 'EMPLOYEE'.</p>
<p>In top of database connection window you will see the location of DBExpress 
  configuration files, the most important parameters of this sample are <b>Database, 
  User_Name and Password</b>. If you use Interbase/Firebird you are safe to set 
  TransIsolation level to Repeteable Read so the report will be database consistent, 
  else see documentation of your database engine to know the recommended transaction 
  isolation for reporting operations (read only, long in time transactions).</p>
<p>You can test the connection and close the database connections configuration 
  window.</p>
<p>Now it's time to setup the dataset, select the datasets page and add a dataset 
  named 'CUSTOMER'.</p>
<p>Add EMPLOYEE connection name and lets go to write a SQL sentence to obtain 
  customer data, to do that click 'Add' Button, enter a alias for the dataset 
  and enter the correct SQL sentence:</p>
<p><img src="images/opendata4.jpg" width="565" height="422"></p>
<p>You can examine database tables and fields using the database browser to help 
  you in the SQL sentence construction, to check and view the dataset click 'Show 
  data' button.</p>
<p><img src="images/opendata5.jpg" width="376" height="315"> </p>
<p>You can navigate (unidirectional) throught the dataset, close this windows 
  and click 'Ok' button to save and go to the main report design window.</p>
<p>Now you must assign the dataset to the subreport, click the subreport item 
  in the design tree and select it in the object inspector:</p>

<p>This is nice moment to save the report, after saving we will <a href="droppingfields.html">drop 
  fields and preview</a> the report.</p>
