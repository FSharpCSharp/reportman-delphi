<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Engine overview, how it works?</h3>
<p>This is a brief introduction of how Report Manager process a report so you 
  can understand the result and design reports in a efficient way.</p>
<p><b>Report Components</b></p>
<table border="1">
  <tr> 
    <td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><b>Name</b></td>
    <td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><b>Datasets</b></td>
    <td>Datasets are <b>optional but a report usually prints data stored in datasets</b>, 
      the datasets are opened at the beginning of the process, you can <b>open 
      several datasets and establish relations between them</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><b>Parameters</b></td>
    <td>Parameters are variables that can be printed and can be entered by the 
      end user, <b>you can assign parameters to datasets (parametrized querys)</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><b>Subreport</b></td>
    <td>A Report contains <b>at least one subreport</b>, if it has more than one 
      the engine will process them in natural order. You can <b>assign a dataset 
      to a subreport</b>, if you assign a dataset the engine will print all the 
      <b>detail type sections once for each record</b> in the dataset, else it 
      will print detail sections once</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><b>Sections</b></td>
    <td>A Subreport contains sections (<b>bands</b>), the most common section 
      type is <b>detail</b>, but other are <b>page headers, page footers</b> and 
      <b>group headers and footers</b>. The engine will print page headers and 
      footers as necessary, it will check group changes, print group headers and 
      footers and print the detail type sections for each record of the dataset 
      assigned to the subreport. A section have useful properties like print condition, 
      align bottom, horizontal displacement etc...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><b>Components</b></td>
    <td>Each section can contain components, the components are the really printable 
      items, they are <b>labels, expressions (dataset fields), images, drawings...</b>, 
      this componets have properties like Font properties, color, print condition...</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The engine process subreports, using assigned datasets, printing sections (page 
  headers, footers and details). To print a section means to print all the components 
  contained in it and advance print position by the size of the printed section.</p>
