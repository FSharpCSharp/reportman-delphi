<h3><b>Report Manager Frequently Asked Questions</b></h3>
<p><b>Q. Why does my report show only one record?</b></p>
<p>You must assign main dataset property of your subreport to a dataset. Because 
  you can open as many datasets as you want you must say the engine which is the 
  dataset for the subreport printing procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Q. I have some problem, where can I find a user group for this tool?</strong></p>
<p>You should use the reportman group at yahoo groups, there, you will find other 
  Report Manager users. Do not e-mail directly to the author unless you want to 
  contract paid support.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Can I contribute to Report Manager project?</strong></p>
<p>Enhacements and new modules for the engine are welcome, you can also report 
  bugs, bufixes ideas etc, use reportman group at yahoo groups for this tasks. 
  You can also contract the author services and pay for new features.</p>
<p><b>Q. Wich development environments supports the engine?</b> </p>
<p>A.
<p>a) <code>In <b>native mode</b> (linked inside the executable or as a Borland 
  package):<br>
  - Delphi 4,5 Enterprise. Delphi 6 Professional, Delphi 6 Enterprise. Delphi 
  7 Desktop, Delphi 7 Enterprise, Delphi 7 Architech.<br>
  - C++Builder 4,5 Enterprise. C++Builder 6 Professional, C++Builder6 Enterprise.<br>
  - Kylix 1,2,3 Desktop and Enterprise. Kylix 1,2,3 Open Edition-FreeCLX.<br>
  b) . In <b>ActiveX mode</b> (distribution of Reportman.ocx-Windows only needed):<br>
  - Any Delphi/C++Builder version accepting ActiveX controls (Borland personal 
  editions)<br>
  - Any development environment accepting ActiveX controls, Visual C++, Visual 
  Basic, Visual Foxpro...<br>
  c) In <b>command line tools mode</b> (executing command line tools):<br>
  - Any language capable of executing command line tools, PHP, bourne shell, python..., 
  command line tools are available for Linux and Windows<br>
  d) In <b>shared library mode</b>:<br>
  - Any compiler or development enviroment capable of using standard C shared 
  library functions, that is GCC compiler, FreePascal compiler..., distribution 
  of reportmanapiqt.so/reportmanapi.so (Linux) and Reportman.ocx needed.</code> 
<p><b>Q. How can I set report parameters at runtime?</b> </p>
<p>A. <code>CLXReport1.Report.Params.ParamByName('CUSTOMERINI').Value:=2;</code></p>
<p><b>Q. How can I show the parameters before executing?</b></p>
<p>A. <code>if CLXReport1.ShowParams then CLXReport1.Execute</code>;</p>
<p><b>Q. What about passing application opened datasets to the report?</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Place a TRpAlias component beside the TCLXReport</li>
  <li>Assign AliasList property or CLXReport to RPAlias compoenent.</li>
  <li>In RpAlias, List property add items as alias and TDataset component to assign 
    to the report. Note: In Delphi 5, in latest versions you can edit datasets 
    with a visual property editor.</li>
  <li>At runtime:</li>
</ul>
<code>var aitem:TRpAliasListIte</code><code>m;<br>
begin<br>
aitem:=RPAliasItem.List.Add;<br>
aitem.alias:='AREPORTALIAS';<br>
aitem.dataset:=adataset;<br>
end</code>
<p><b>Q. How can I alter the SQL sentence of a report dataset before executing 
  it?</b></p>
<p>A. CLXReport.Report.DataInfo.Items[0].SQL:='SELECT....'</p>
<p><b>Q. How can I pass opened connections or path to databases to the report?</b></p>
<p>A. Depend on the database driver used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>BDE should detect opened aliases</li>
  <li>DBExpress: <code>CLXReport.Report.DabaseInfo.Items[0].SQLConnection:=..</code></li>
  <li>ADO: <code>CLXReport.Report.DabaseInfo.Items[0].ConnectionString</code></li>
  <li>Interbase Express: <code>CLXReport.Report.DabaseInfo.Items[0].IBConnection:=..</code></li>
  <li><code>Zeos: CLXReport.Report.DatabaseInfo.Items[0].ZConnection:=..</code></li>
  <li>Other still not implemented, but you can update dbxconnections.ini, because 
    them read the configuration from this file</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q. How can I set properties of components at runtime in already loaded report?</b> 
</p>
<code>A.You must find the component you want to modify, Report property in TCLXReport 
  is the owner of all report items:<br>
uses rplabelitem;</cbr>
...<br>
var acompo:TRpExpression;<br>
acompo:=TRpExpression(CLXReport1.Report.FindComponent('TRpExpression5'));<br>
if Assigned(compo) then<br>
begin<br>
acompo.DisplayFormat:='dd/mm/yyyy';<br>
end<br>
</code>
Note: When assigning text or expression properties declare the variables 
  you assign as WideString.<br>
<p><b>Q. I'm designing a report that will be printed in any matrix printer or 
  receipt printer, how can I use printer fonts to speed up the print process?</b></p>
<p>A. In Windows platform, at page setup option of Report Manager Designer you 
  can set use allways device fonts option. Allways install the correct driver 
  for the printer or a driver that printer is emulating. For other methods see 
  answer bellow.</p>

<p><b>Q. Why Report Manager needs TClientDataset class?</b></p>
<p> The engine must be capable of go back one record for the main dataset (Prior 
  procedure) because grouping feature, but some datasets only support unidirectional 
  datasets, I use a patched version of TClientDataset (TRpDataset), that no eats 
  lots of memory like TClientDataset, it frees the records it does not need so 
  the engine can print/proces millions of records without memory problems but 
  a bit slower if you print only a few thousand records.</p>
<p>Because this, Delphi 5 Professional or lower can not be used as native components 
  but you can use the ActiveX control.</p>
<p><b>Q. Is Report Manager Engine Thread Safe so it can be used in multithreaded 
  applications (servers)?</b></p>
<p>Report Manager is thread safe but there are some issues not only related to 
  Report Manager:<br>
  - BDE is not thread safe by default (a session must be open for each thread), 
  you can assign a session to a database report or you can assign a TDatabase 
  directly to the database report component in runtime.<br>
  - Warning about local dabase access modes, some database engines like Interbase/Firebird 
  allow to set a path to the database directly (c:\database.gdb) using local access 
  to database, you must avoid this because it's not thread safe you must use net 
  access mode allways (localhost:c:\database.gdb)<br>
  - Not all VisualCLX components are thread safe so you need to modify this VisualCLX 
  components in the main thread, so the designer package is (becasuse this issue) 
  not thread safe.</p>
<p><b>Q. Can Report Manager print in dot matrix printers in Linux as fast as in 
  Windows?</b></p>
<p>Windows provides drivers and those drivers provide printer specific fonts, 
  so the Windows GDI can merge graphics and texts, the printer driver does the 
  real hard work of printing, Report Manager only search for the best suited font 
  (a printer font) in Windows font list, select it and call Windows specific API 
  to draw the text (this is the behaviour for use device fonts option)</p>
<p>For Linux, Report Manager uses the Kylix graphic engine that uses the Qt graphic 
  engine, the Qt graphics engine writes output usually in postcript and then the 
  printer filter transform it to a understandable language to the printer (usually 
  this work is done by ghostcript).</p>
<p>So you can use a printer filter to convert postcript to text or better is the 
  use of dot matrix and pos device feature, see documentation, the engine can 
  generate text output with printer escape codes in Windows and Linux. See documentation.</p>
<p><b>Q. Why does my report using Group Headers give strange results?</b></p>
<p>For reports including group headers to work correctly the order of the data
within the report must match the grouping structure of the report. Therefore the
SQL statement returning the data (for example SQL SELECT) must include code to
order the data to match the report definition. </p>
<p><b>Q. Why does my Active Server Page freeze when using the ActiveX control?</b></p>
<p>Active Server Pages (ASP) must not produce any console output for correct
operation. ASP can correctly invoke the ActiveX control to generate PDF output
if the following rules are followed</p>
<ul>
<li>You must use version 1.3+ of the OCX</li>
<li>All of the properties to suppress output and dialogs to the console must be
suppressed </li>
</ul>
<p>Previewing the report will not work from within an ASP program. Printing the 
  report may also fail based on the printing environment setup on the Web server 
  running the ASP (privileges). </p>
<p><b>Q. What is two pass report option? What is the use of this feature?</b></p>
<p>The engine is capable of preview the first page before calculating all the 
  pages (can be thousands), this is the default behaviour for speed and memory 
  consumtion (when printing, pages printed are released from memory).</p>
<p>The engine is also capable of printing the total pages in the first page,it's 
  also capable of going back to the first page to process a new subreport (paralel 
  subreports), so you can print in the first page as many subreports as you want.</p>
<p>The printing of total pages (PAGECOUNT) requires the previous calculation of 
  the report, then PAGECOUNT is replaced with the total number of pages, the page 
  count special expression can't be used inside expressions..</p>
<p>So two pass report must be used for both cases, PAGECOUNT and SkipToPage. I 
  doubt other engines implement SkipToPage, and I doubt other engines allow using 
  PAGECOUNT in expressions, (for example in print condition of a section because 
  can produce a dead lock).</p>
<p><b>Q. While using the report in my software this error occur: Property xxx 
  does not exists, what is wrong?</b></p>
<p>You are reading a report saved with a new version, and your components installation 
  (Delphi/Builder/Kylix) or your ActiveX component is older, so it's not able 
  to execute reports that have new (unknown) properties onm it. Just reinstall 
  the components with the newest version (Delphi/Builder/Kylix) or ActiveX control.</p>
