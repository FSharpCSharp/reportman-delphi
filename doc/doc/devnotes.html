<h3>Devoloper notes about Report Manager</h3>
<h4>TClientDataset and BCD types, why Delphi 5 enterprise version at least need</h4>
<p>TRpDataset (rpdataset.pas) is a TClientDataset to buffer all the datasets passed 
  to the engine that can feature grouping, so the main dataset go forward only 
  (support for unidirectional datasets like SQLExpress), but the engine can remember 
  at least two records to do grouping. Somebody said me last version of some reporting 
  engines does not allow grouping if the dataset is unidirectional...</p>
<p>The method to implement TRpDataset is duplicate fields of new Dataset to a 
  newly created TClientDataset (rpdataset)<br>
</p>
<p>Then assign fields and post the record in memory...</p>
<p>for i:=0 to fieldcount-1 do<br>
  fields[i].Assign(fielddefs[i]);</p>
<p>It's a bit more complex because needs freeing memory (garbage old records)</p>
<p>This worked fine inclusive passing opened datasets to the engine until I updated 
  to Delphi 7, where blob fields assignements are broken, I added the function 
  AssignField(Source,Destination), and a compiler define, active for Delphi 7 
  (BLOBSTREAMBUG) so assignement for blobfields are patched in this function.</p>
<p>If you find an assignment fails using a particular type (like BCD) you can 
  patch the assignment there, send me the bugfix so I will add a compiler define 
  for the bug and add to the main tree.</p>
<p>BCD is a problematic type, see for example FormatVariant function in rptypes.pas.</p>
<h4>Borland changes in TFiler in Delphi 6 and up</h4>
<p>Borland have changed the way it stores WideStrings because Utf8 support.<br>
  (TFiler,TWriter,TReader) since Delphi 6, so because the engine can be compiled 
  with any version of Delphi/Builder/Kylix, WideStrings properties are written 
  in a custom way, really they are written in the Delphi 4/5 way.<br>
  WideString properties are TRpLabel text, Font names, etc.</p>
<p>From classes.pas</p>
<p>procedure TWriter.WriteWideString(const Value: WideString);<br>
  var<br>
  L: Integer;<br>
  Utf8Str: UTF8String;<br>
  begin<br>
  Utf8Str := Utf8Encode(Value);<br>
  if Length(Utf8Str) &lt; (Length(Value) * SizeOf(WideChar)) then<br>
  WriteMinStr(Value, Utf8Str)<br>
  else<br>
  begin<br>
  WriteValue(vaWString);<br>
  L := Length(Value);<br>
  Write(L, SizeOf(Integer));<br>
  Write(Pointer(Value)^, L * 2);<br>
  end;<br>
  end;</p>
<p>This causes a incompatibility with earlier versions of Delphi.</p>
<p>The workaround is a to store all the widestring properties as <br>
  special properties defined in DefineProperties of each report <br>
  streamable component, and write and read the widestrings using the <br>
  old Delphi 5 method.</p>
<p>This problem was fixed in 1.2 version.</p>
<h4>The horrible bug in Delphi 7 about TComboBox (VCL) empty items</h4>
<p>Delphi 7 has a horrible bug, when you place a TCombobox in a form, with a empty 
  selectable item (csDropDownList), at run time, selecting this item the application 
  will crash (Win9x), or raise an exception in ntdll (WinNT) or work correctly 
  (WinXP).</p>
<p>A patch for this issue is expected in a service pack, but for now all the empty 
  selectable items of comboboxes are replaced with a a space (' ') to solve this 
  issue. For your convenience the engine also includes a patch unit (D7GetComboBoxStringsPatch.pas) 
  for your projects</p>
<p><b>The Open/Save dialog Windows CLX bug since Delphi 7</b></p>
<p>Delphi 7 has another horrible bug in CLX Open/Save Dialogs, a 'Drive C: not 
  found' exception is raised if you try to select a file that is not in the root 
  dir, but only in Win9x systems, in WinNT/XP works ok. Because for windows a 
  pure VCL version is provided (repmandxp.exe) I don't worry about this issue 
  but if you find a workaround feel free to send me it. You can reproduce it compiling 
  repmand.exe for Windows and saving files in Windows 9x OS.</p>
<p><b>BiDi Support </b></p>
<p>Bidi support is now implemented allowing each label to have a diffetent value 
  for each language, here are the comments about the user introducing the main 
  idea. </p>
<p><b>(ez_bikbon@hotmail.com)</b></p>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br>
  ------------------------</p>
<p>I think that you should not bother yourself too much with providing<br>
  full BiDi support within RepMan. Instead, you should do what Delphi<br>
  controls do - let Windows API do the work. I'll explain in a little<br>
  more detail.</p>
<p>There are many small details surrounding BiDi, but all of them can be<br>
  grouped into two major problems: BiDi layout, and BiDi text input/output.</p>
<p>BIDI LAYOUT<br>
  ------------------------</p>
<p>The layout problem is a bit complicated, becuase everything has to be<br>
  calculated in reverse. For example, when you create a right-to-left<br>
  (RTL) drop down field, you need to:<br>
  1. Place the field label to the right of the input box.<br>
  2. Place any drop down icon to the left of the field.<br>
  3. Draw the drop-down box aligned to the right of the input box.</p>
<p>However, BiDi layout is NOT IMPORTANT for printed reports. Reports are<br>
  mostly made of text objects and the positioning of is easily<br>
  determined at design time.</p>
<p>Of course that having full BiDi layout support is nice, and my guess<br>
  is that it will not be very difficult to implement. But even without<br>
  it, most users will be able to create right-aligned reports quite easily.</p>
<p>BIDI TEXT<br>
  ------------------------</p>
<p>The other BiDi problem is correct input and output of text. We can<br>
  ignore the input, becuase report objects are for output only.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this should be VERY easy to solve, becuase you can<br>
  duplicate Delphi's text output methods. Actually Delphi only calls the<br>
  Windows API with the required parameters, and Windows does the work.</p>
<p>POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS<br>
  ------------------------</p>
<p>I think that adding BiDi text output should be really easy. Probably<br>
  all you need to do is:</p>
<p>1. Add BiDiMode and ParentBiDiMode properties (and some related<br>
  methods) to the report objects. You can look at an example in Delphi<br>
  source code for TControl in unit Controls.</p>
<p>2. Duplicate the way Delphi controls call DrawText - I think that you<br>
  only need to add a flag depending on the BiDiMode property. You can<br>
  look at an example in Delphi source code for TLabel in unit StdCtrls.</p>
<p>Another approach can require more work now, but may be better in the<br>
  long run: make RepMan objects descendants of Delphi controls, such as<br>
  TLabel, and use their output methods. This way your code will benefit<br>
  from future improvements to Delphi, like Unicode support.</p>
<p>WINDOWS vs. LINUX<br>
  ------------------------</p>
<p>The only remaining issue is compatability between Windows and Linux. </p>
<p>As I mentioned, Delphi uses the underlying OS (or graphics library)<br>
  for BiDi text input and output. The VCL libraries call the Windows API<br>
  which has full BiDi capabilities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the QT library does not support BiDi, so at the moment<br>
  Delphi-CLX (and Kylix) don't support BiDi. (The most recent versions<br>
  of QT do have BiDi, but Delphi's CLX is built on older versions.)</p>
<p>So CLX/Kylix compatability is not relevant at the moment, because<br>
  there's no way to create BiDi applications at all with QT, so there's<br>
  no point to worry about the reports...</p>
<p>CONCLUSION<br>
  ------------------------</p>
<p>Out of two major issues, the big one (BiDi layout) is not really a<br>
  problem for reports, and the smaller one (BiDi text output) can be<br>
  solved easily.</p>
<p>I do hope very much that you decide to enable BiDi, and I will be glad<br>
  to test it for you and help you make it work. If indeed RepMan will<br>
  support BiDi, then I intend to purchase a copy, and I will also help<br>
  you add further features such as Hebrew translation, BiDi layout, etc.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>EZ.</p>
