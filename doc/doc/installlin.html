<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>Linux Installation</h3>
<p>Installing Report Manager Designer in Linux is a easy process also, you must 
  have <b>root rights if you want to install to allow all users to execute it 
  or if rpm installation system is used</b>.</p>
<p>See <a href="requirements.html">hardware and software requirements</a> before 
  installing Report Manager designer.</p>
<p>You must <b>download the latest Report Manager for Linux version</b> from sourceforge:</p>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/reportman" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/reportman</a></p>
<p><b>RPM Package Installation</b></p>
<p>May be you distribution uses .rpm packages and a .rpm package is available 
  for download, in this case use your own installation distribution procedure 
  or go to the command line and write:</p>
<p>rpm -U reportmand-1.0.i386.rpm</p>
<p><b>tar.gz File Installation</b></p>
<p>If you downloaded a .tar.gz file then you must create a directory and place 
  the downloaded file there:</p>
<p><code>make /opt/repmand</code></p>
<p><code>mv reportmand-1.0.tar.gz /opt/repmand</code></p>
<p>Note: If you are not root you can place it in /home/youusername/repmand for 
  example. </p>
<p>Change to that directory and untar the files</p>
<p><code>cd /opt/repmand</code></p>
<p><code>tar zxvf repmand.tar.gz</code></p>
<p>After that a number of files in the current dir will be created.</p>
<p>Execute repmand.sh to start Report Manager designer:</p>
<p><code>./repmand.sh</code></p>
<p><b>System Libraries Issues</b></p>
<p>When you execute a Linux application it searchs libraries using LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
  variable, repmand.sh set this variable to search the current directory first. 
  To call any command line tool you must set also this option or you can set it 
  system wide. The launcher repmand.bin will set also the variable before calling 
  the application repmand.</p>
<p>Also there are issues with Borland provided qt libraries, see<a href="knownissues.html"> 
  known issues</a> if you have problems starting the application.</p>
<p><b>Database configuration files</b></p>
<p>Report Manager Designer will look for database configuration files, it will 
  look first at <b>/home/yourusername/.borland</b> directory, will search for 
  'dbxdrivers' and 'dbxconnections' files, if there are no files there it will 
  search at '/usr/local/etc' for files 'dbxdrivers.conf' and 'dbxconnections.conf', 
  if this files does not exists it will search in the current executable directory 
  and will copy them to /home/yourusername/.borland. So any user executing Report 
  Manager Designer can own their database connections file or use system common 
  configuration files.</p>
<p>When you execute Report Manager command line tools or applications from other 
  applications (like apache web server) you should copy the database configuration 
  files to correct path following the above explanation.</p>
<p><b>Printer configuration file</b></p>
<p>Report Manager Designer will use a Printer configuration file, only used in 
  printer selection, this file will be searched as /etc/reporman, if not found 
  it will create or use /home/yourusername/.reportman</p>
<p><strong>Environment variables</strong></p>
<p>You can define a special environment variable to enable, by default, the use 
  of kprinter to print reports, this will allow to select the diferent options 
  in the kprinter dialog.</p>
<p>export REPMAN_USEKPRINTER=true</p>
<p>Before showing print dialog, the report will be transformed to Adobe PDF, then 
  converted to postcript using pdftops command line tool (so Xpdf package installation 
  is required), the resulting postcript file will be sent to kprinter command 
  line tool and the user will see the kprinter print dialog.</p>
<p>The operations that the engine performs internally are:</p>
<p>printerreptopdf -u yourreport.rep pdffile.pdf</p>
<p>pdftops pdffile.pdf postcriptfile.ps</p>
<p>kprinter postcriptfile.ps</p>
<p>The main diference is when you use kprinter the report must be calculated entirely 
  before showing the print dialog, and if the report is very long and you want 
  to print only one page, a lot of processing time may be not really useful.</p>
