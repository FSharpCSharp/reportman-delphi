IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW OF THE REPORT MANAGER REPORTING ENGINE

What's internally a report definition?
- It's a component with some properties and a collection of subreports, a subreport is also a component that has some properties and a collection of sections, each section has some properties and a collection of finally printable components (fields, texts, images).

How is stored and readed (streamed) a report definition?
- Because it's a component, it can be streamed using the delphi/kylix component streaming engine (classes.pas), so it's fast,
generates small files and very little code to implement it.

How works the print engine?
- It prints the first subreport, then the second subreport...:-)

Well, then how is printed a subreport?
1- Opens the dataset definitions. If the main dataset is eof does nothing.
2- Prints the report headers if exists.
3- For each page:
 a-Prints the page headers if exists.
 b-Prints group headers until the first detail.
 c-Prints details until a group condition change or eof.
 d-Prints footers until group condition and then go to pass b.
 Notes:
	- All group footers are printed after eof.
	- If a group header or footer can't fit, gen. new page. 
4- Prints the report footers if exists.
